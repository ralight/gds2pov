GDSTO3D
=======

Introduction
------------

GDSTO3D is a collection of programs to process GDS2 layout files.

GDS2 files are used for storing the geometrical and layer information for 
creating an IC or MEMS device. If you do not what this is, GDSTO3D is 
probably of no interest to you!

GDS2POV is a program to take a GDS2 layout file and output a POV-Ray scene 
description file of the GDS2 data. This allows the creation of attractive 3D 
pictures of a layout. POV-Ray is a completely free, cross platform ray tracer.
It can be obtained from http://www.povray.org/

GDSOGLVIEWER is an OpenGL viewer that can show GDS2 files. It's not very good
yet!

GDS2SVG converts GDS2 files to Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) files. This is
still experimental as well, but give it a try. "It works for me". Mostly,
anyway.


I would love to hear from you if you produce any nice results! See the contact 
section at the bottom of this document.


Compiling
---------

gdsto3d uses 'cmake' to configure its build environment. This means it is
possible to support lots of different systems and build tools.

To build gdsto3d, change to the 'build' directory and type 'cmake ..'. This
should generate the required files. The build directory contains only
generated files so it can be completely removed if required. Typically on Unix
systems you would type 'make' followed by 'make install' to compile and
install the software respectively.

Typing just 'cmake' should give you a list of options to specify for cmake,
including a list of generators which can be used to generate the files for
different build tools. For example, you might be able to use the following
command to generate files for KDevelop.

cmake -G KDevelop3 ..


General Usage
-------------

Usage is mostly the same across the programs. You can always try:

program -h

to get the specific usage information.


gds2pov [-i input.gds] [-o output.pov] [-b] [-c config.txt] [-p process.txt] [-t topcell] [-v]

 -b	Output bounding box instead of the layout to allow easier and quicker
	placing of the camera. It is much quicker to render a box than an IC!
 -c	Specify config file
 -g Generate process file from gds2 file information (suppresses generation of
    output file).
 -h Show usage
 -i Input GDS2 file (stdin if not given)
 -o Output POV file (stdout if not given)
 -p	Specify process file
 -q Quiet output
 -t	Specify top cell name
 -v	Verbose output

First steps - what do you need at the absolute minimum? This program, a GDS2 
file and a file describing your process to GDS2POV.

An example process file is provided with this package and is called 
example_process.txt. This file should give you all the information you need on 
how to create a configuration for your own process. You will also need the layer 
information for your process as well as the height and thickness of the layers 
if you have it and want the output to be more accurate.

Note: POV-Ray prefers it if objects are not perfectly aligned with one another. 
That is to say, it would prefer a box at (0,0,0) extending in the +x direction 
and a box at (1,0,0) extending in the -x direction to a box at (0,0,0) extending 
in the +x direction and a box at (0,0,0) extending in the -x direction. I hope 
that is clear. Anyway, what this means is that when you are defining the height 
and thickness for adjacent layers, make sure that they overlap just slightly. 
This is the reason for the slightly odd numbers in example_process.txt.

So, you have everything. Just run:

gds2pov -i input.gds -o output.pov -p process.txt

This will produce a POV file with the camera directly above the centre of the 
layout looking down. No extra lights are defined.


If you want a more complicated arrangement there are further options.

Firstly, you can edit the camera and lighting settings in the POV file by hand. 
GDS2POV outputs a number of comments at the start of the POV file which give 
the extent of the GDS2 data. You can use these co-ordinates to help position 
lights and the camera where you wish.

The second option is to use a config file. An example config file is provided
and is called config.txt. To use a config file with GDS2POV, try the following:

gds2pov input.gds output.pov -c config.txt

The config file allows you to set the ambient light level, a process file and 
the position of the camera, where the camera is looking as well as defining 
any number of additional lights. See config.txt for more information.

If gds2pov does not find your top cell correctly, use the -t option to specify the top cell name.


Using the POV File
------------------

It is beyond the scope of this document to describe how best to use POV-Ray.
The POV-Ray documentation is excellent, but there are some settings that may 
be particularly useful for GDS2POV generated files.

The most notable is probably Quality. Setting Quality to 1 (the default is 9) 
will use a high level of ambient light, no other lights and will ignore shadows 
and any special surfaces on objects. This means that the rendering time will be
greatly reduced. Set the Quality to 9 again to render your final image.

To set the quality in a render ini file, use the line

Quality=9

Or to set it on the command line, use

+Q9

If you have suggestions for other useful settings, please send them to me for
inclusion.


Known Problems
--------------

* Support for the GDS2 format is incomplete. Support is provided for 
everything that the author considers important. Text alignment for example 
is not that critical (compared to placement of paths and cells). If this is 
important to you, please contact me. Any unsupported features found in a 
GDS2 file will be noted when GDS2POV runs, but will be ignored and the rest
of the file parsed.

* Concave polygons will not be created properly in POV-Ray. This is a *hard*
and well recognised problem in general. Papers do exist describing how to 
deal with the problem but I am not yet ready to delve into it. My advice: 
avoid merging multiple polygons/paths.

* Summary only considers a single instance of each object.

* Big files take a long time and a lot of memory to render. Yes... try 
  reducing the quality and size of your output picture in POV-Ray. I don't 
  really envisage GDS2POV being used on complete chips - POV-Ray is limited 
  to 2GB of RAM on 32 bit machines and it is quite possible to use that with 
  a complicated GDS2 file.

* Lack of support for other platforms. Coming as I get chance.
