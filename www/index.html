<h2>What is gds2pov?</h2>
<p>GDS2POV is a program to take a GDS2 layout file and output a POV-Ray scene 
description file of the GDS2 data. This allows the creation of attractive 3D pictures of a layout.</p>
<p>Look at an example (click to enlarge):</p>
<p>
<a href="images/example_2D.png"><img src="images/thumbs/t_example_2D.png" width="100" height="76" alt="2D Example"/></a> 
<a href="images/example_3D.png"><img src="images/thumbs/t_example_3D.png" width="100" height="76" alt="3D Example"/></a> 
</p>
<p>POV-Ray is a completely free, cross platform ray tracer. It can be obtained 
from <a href="http://www.povray.org/">http://www.povray.org/</a></p>

<p>Please forgive - these images have been resized and saved as jpg to save on file size. It hasn't done them much good!</p>
