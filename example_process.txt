# Process configuration file for gds2pov

# Lines starting with a # are comments.
#
# This file describes a made up p-sub, single well 4 layer metal CMOS process.
#
# This file consists of Layer entries in the following format:
#
# LayerStart: LayerName
# Layer: LayerNumber (integer)
# Datatype: (integer)
# Height: (float) - See NOTE below
# Thickness: (float) - See NOTE below
# Red: (float, between 0,1 with 1 being full)
# Green: (float, between 0,1 with 1 being full)
# Blue: (float, between 0,1 with 1 being full)
# Filter: (float, between 0,1 with 1 being full)
# Metal: (boolean, 0 or 1)
# Show: (boolean, 0 or 1)
# LayerEnd
#
# Filter defines the transparency of the layer, with 1 being the most
# transparent. It actually works for values greater than 1, but the povray
# documentation states that it is limited to 1 so don't rely on it.
#
# Metal, when set to 1, will make the layer slightly reflective.
# Show defines whether the layer is shown or not.
#
# The only compulsory items are LayerStart, Layer and LayerEnd. If any value is ommitted, the default 
# will be used. The defaults are:
#
# Datatype: -1	     (meaning all datatypes for this layer)
# Height: 0
# Thickness: 0       (thickness of 0 means the layer will not be shown)
# Red: 0.0
# Green: 0.0
# Blue: 0.0
# Filter: 0.0
# Metal: 0
# Show: 0            (do *not* show by default)
# 
# 
# If any layer is not listed in this file it will be ignored in the gds2 file.
#
# NOTE
# ====
#
# The numbers given here for Height and Thickness are specified in DB units. This is defined in your GDS2 file
# (not the process!), which is why the Height and Thickness must use them. To find the DB units for your GDS2 
# file, just run the file through GDS2POV and it will provide the information.
