Version 0.7.3 (23rd November 2004)
==================================

- Fixed occasional problem with invalid characters being printed in layer
  names. Thanks to Scott Lin.
- Fixed boundary calculation when an SREF only contained other SREFs.
- SREF boundaries are now output when the -v option is given.

Version 0.7.2 (17th November 2004)
==================================

- Fixed texture definition problem under Windows.
- Fixed texture definition when texture is a metal.

Version 0.7.1 (16th November 2004)
==================================

- Improved the way textures are defined in the .pov file which reduces the
  size of the file substantially for large designs.
- Fixed command line parsing problem. Thanks to S. Lin for spotting the
  problem.

Version 0.7 (28th September 2004)
=================================

- Added option to specify the top cell name as suggested by Markus Dorn.
- Added option to output a bounding box the same size and shape as the layout 
  instead of the layout. This renders almost instantaneously so can be used to
  place the camera more effectively.
- Empty cells no longer break the boundary detection.
- Fixed bug causing the wrong cell to be selected in boundary calculation which
  was leading to crashes in certain situations (Guenter Grau).

Version 0.6 (17th August 2004)
==============================

- Added verbose output option for helping debug problems with gds2 files.
- Default font used is crystal.ttf (supplied with POV-Ray) and font is definable
  in config.txt
- Invalid characters in structure names are replaced with _. Thanks to Guenter 
  Grau for highlighting this problem.
- Support for offset and variable paths added. Octagonal paths are treated as 
  offset paths.
- XY records for unsupported elements (BOX, NODE) will now be parsed completely 
  so the whole file can be parsed.
- If Datatype is not specified in a layer definition in the process file, the 
  layer definition will be used for all datatypes in that layer. Thanks to 
  Guenter Grau for this suggestion.
