Version 0.6 (17th August 2004)
==============================

- Added verbose output option for helping debug problems with gds2 files.
- Default font used is crystal.ttf (supplied with POV-Ray) and font is definable
  in config.txt
- Invalid characters in structure names are replaced with _. Thanks to Guenter 
  Grau for highlighting this problem.
- Support for offset and variable paths added. Octagonal paths are treated as 
  offset paths.
- XY records for unsupported elements (BOX, NODE) will now be parsed completely 
  so the whole file can be parsed.
- If Datatype is not specified in a layer definition in the process file, the 
  layer definition will be used for all datatypes in that layer. Thanks to 
  Guenter Grau for this suggestion.
