Version 20080229
================

- Number of fixes to provide gcc 4.3 support.
- New feature for gds2pov and gds2svg: use the "-g" option to automatically
  generate a process file with information based on the layers found in the
  supplied gds2 file.


Version 20070827
================

- Minor fix for building on multilib Linux x86_64 machines. Thanks to
  Chitlesh Goorah.


Version 20070815
================

- Build fixes for Windows.
- Update library search path on install on Unix systems.


Version 20070813
================

- Fixed erroneous URLs in the help for each program.
- Changed the build chain to use cmake instead of autotools.

Thanks to Mark Wilmott:

- Top level cell is correctly placed within the canvas when using gds2svg.


Version 20070426
================

Thanks to Matt Hopcroft:

- Layers with height=0 were not being processed (should've been
  thickness=0).


Version 20061130
================

- Fixes to the build process.
- Memory stability fixes.


Version 20061012
================

- Fixed compile errors on msys due to u_int16_t being defined as uint16_t.

These changes thanks to Arun Persaud:

- Added simple support for Boxes (they are treated as Boundaries)
- gdsoglviewer uses the config.txt settings to set the initial position.
- gdsoglviewer displays a camera and lookat position which can be used in gds2pov.
- Zero width paths no longer prevent the rest of the GDS2 file being parsed.
- An error in the type of the STYPTABLE record was fixed.

These changes suggested by Frederic Pecourt:

- Added the option of using a camera include file in gds2pov rather than
  calculating the camera position inside the main pov file.

Version 20060301
================

- Changed libgdsto3d long and short types to int32_t and int16_t as appropriate
  problems when long and short change size.

Version 20060228
================

- Fixed gds2pov -b option which wasn't producing any output.

Version 20060227
================

- Added gds2svg
- Fixed other minor problems

Version 0.7.3 (23rd November 2004)
==================================

- Fixed occasional problem with invalid characters being printed in layer
  names. Thanks to Scott Lin.
- Fixed boundary calculation when an SREF only contained other SREFs.
- SREF boundaries are now output when the -v option is given.

Version 0.7.2 (17th November 2004)
==================================

- Fixed texture definition problem under Windows.
- Fixed texture definition when texture is a metal.

Version 0.7.1 (16th November 2004)
==================================

- Improved the way textures are defined in the .pov file which reduces the
  size of the file substantially for large designs.
- Fixed command line parsing problem. Thanks to S. Lin for spotting the
  problem.

Version 0.7 (28th September 2004)
=================================

- Added option to specify the top cell name as suggested by Markus Dorn.
- Added option to output a bounding box the same size and shape as the layout 
  instead of the layout. This renders almost instantaneously so can be used to
  place the camera more effectively.
- Empty cells no longer break the boundary detection.
- Fixed bug causing the wrong cell to be selected in boundary calculation which
  was leading to crashes in certain situations (Guenter Grau).

Version 0.6 (17th August 2004)
==============================

- Added verbose output option for helping debug problems with gds2 files.
- Default font used is crystal.ttf (supplied with POV-Ray) and font is definable
  in config.txt
- Invalid characters in structure names are replaced with _. Thanks to Guenter 
  Grau for highlighting this problem.
- Support for offset and variable paths added. Octagonal paths are treated as 
  offset paths.
- XY records for unsupported elements (BOX, NODE) will now be parsed completely 
  so the whole file can be parsed.
- If Datatype is not specified in a layer definition in the process file, the 
  layer definition will be used for all datatypes in that layer. Thanks to 
  Guenter Grau for this suggestion.
