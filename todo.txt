To Do
=====
- allow "ignore cells" preference
- graphical process file editor
- absolute camera position
- What if top cell isn't found?
- Allow use of eg. glade2 techfiles as a process file.
- Should be able to tell whether a gds2 file is empty even if it parsed correctly.
- Make an example skeleton project.

- Need to deal with Text/SRef/ARef rotation issues for boundary calculation
	(relevant to auto placement of camera)
	Also for flipped objects.
- Suitable code for endian decisions. What is there available on BSD?
- Deal with concave polygons. Either implement horrid algo to fill them or
  detect and don't fill.
- Detect text for boundary calculation
- Text scaling with units needs fixing, especially the depth!
- Documentation (source)
- Exception handling
- Code coverage testing
- Incorrect process/config file testing
- Compile examples and other files for distribution.
- Fix invalid display segfaults
- Support for octagonal paths
- Write structures to individual .inc files to reduce memory usage?
- Convert Boundaries into mesh2 objects?
- Camera include file?
- Consider how best to store dimensions in process file - scaled or not?
- Animations

Done
====

- Non-orthogonal paths - look at corners
- Set path parsing and prisms parsing so that the Layer struct item points to
  the appropriate layer rather than the LayerName.
- Replace GetARefName() and GetSRefName() with a more efficient GetARef() and
  GetSRef()
- Extensive refactoring of path, polygon, aref and sref code which should lead
  to increased robustness as well as being easier to maintain.
