Next release
============

- Replace invalid characters in structure names ($)
- Need to deal with Text/SRef/ARef rotation issues for boundary calculation 
	(relevant to auto placement of camera)
	Also for flipped objects.
- Suitable code for endian decisions. What is there available on Solaris/BSD? Would hton* functions be suitable?
- Fix non-orthogonal paths - look at corners
- Deal with concave polygons. Either implement horrid algo to fill them or
  detect and don't fill.
- Detect text for boundary calculation
- Text scaling with units needs fixing, especially the depth!
- Documentation (source)

Tasks: 8


Unlikely
========

- Write structures to individual .inc files to reduce memory usage?
- Convert Boundaries into mesh2 objects?

Tasks: 2
