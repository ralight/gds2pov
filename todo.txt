This release
============

- Need to deal with Text/SRef/ARef rotation issues for boundary calculation 
	(relevant to auto placement of camera)
	Also for flipped objects.
- Suitable code for endian decisions. What is there available on BSD?
- Fix non-orthogonal paths - look at corners
- Deal with concave polygons. Either implement horrid algo to fill them or
  detect and don't fill.
- Detect text for boundary calculation
- Text scaling with units needs fixing, especially the depth!
- Documentation (source)
- Font specifiable in config.txt
- If datatype not specified, use layer definition for all datatypes
- Debug/verbose output
- Exception handling
- Code coverage testing
- Incorrect process/config file testing
- Compile examples and other files for distribution.
- Proper command line option parsing

Tasks: 15

Next release
============

- Support for octagonal paths

Tasks: 1


Unlikely
========

- Write structures to individual .inc files to reduce memory usage?
- Convert Boundaries into mesh2 objects?

Tasks: 2


Ideas
=====

- Camera include file?
- Consider how best to store dimensions in process file - scaled or not?
- Animations

Tasks: 3
