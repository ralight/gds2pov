- Fix the "open prism" problem.
- Better comand line options including being able to specify the process file.
- Parse data into memory and then write out? This would allow the writing out of
the structures in the correct order and would mean that the file would only
need parsing once. This would of course require much more memory!
- To make the above easier, perhaps go to C++?
- Fix the text displaying in the wrong place problem.
- Implement mirrored objects.
- Suitable code for endian decisions. What is there available on Solaris/BSD?
 Would hton* functions be suitable?
- Auto placement of camera.
- Auto placement of lights.
- Deal with convex polygons. Either implement horrid algo to fill them or
  detect and don't fill.
- Make sure correct order structure output is working (see dh_adc).
