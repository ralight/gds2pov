Definite
========

- Fix text positioning
- Auto/defined placement of lights.
- Better command line options including being able to specify the process file.
- Suitable code for endian decisions. What is there available on Solaris/BSD? Would hton* functions be suitable?
- Replace invalid characters in structure names ($)
- Need to deal with Text/SRef/ARef rotation issues for boundary calculation 
	(relevant to auto placement of camera)
	Also for flipped objects.
- Documentation (source and usage)

Tasks: 7


Possible
========

- Fix non-orthogonal paths - look at corners
- Deal with concave polygons. Either implement horrid algo to fill them or
  detect and don't fill.
- Detect text for boundary calculation
- Text scaling with units needs fixing, especially the depth.

Tasks: 4


Unlikely
========

- Write structures to individual .inc files to reduce memory usage?
- Convert Boundaries into mesh2 objects?

Tasks: 2


Ideas
=====

- Camera include file?
- Consider how best to store dimensions in process file - scaled or not?
- Animations

Tasks: 3
