- Better command line options including being able to specify the process file.
- Write structures to individual .inc files to reduce memory usage?
- Implement mirrored objects (text)
- Suitable code for endian decisions. What is there available on Solaris/BSD? Would hton* functions be suitable?
- Auto placement of lights.
- Deal with concave polygons. Either implement horrid algo to fill them or
  detect and don't fill.
- Make sure correct order structure output is working (see dh_adc).
- Replace invalid characters in structure names ($)
- Fix text positioning
- Use correct unit scaling
- Fix errors on missing/incomplete process file
- Need to deal with Text/SRef/ARef rotation issues for boundary calculation 
	(relevant to auto placement of camera)
	Also for flipped objects.
- Detect text for boundary calculation
- Convert Boundaries into mesh2 objects?
- Fix non-orthogonal paths
- Group unused gds2 elements together based on data type so that parsing of a
  file can be done ignoring the unsupported elements.
- Camera include file?
- Add support for datatype or rnDataType to allow eg. RESDEF, DIODE, CAPDEF which are all layer 62!
- Need to test rotated and flipped ARefs
