# This file describes the arrangement of the scene - where the camera will be placed and where it will 
# look at, as well as any light sources.
# Global settings can also be set here.
# Lines with the first character as a # are comments.
#
# Global settings
# ===============
# 
# Only one global block is supported of the following format:
#
# Use Ambient to specify the amount of ambient light in the scene. 1.2 is the default if not specified. 
#
# ProcessFile sets the file from which the process configuration will be read. If it is not specified, 
# process.txt is used as the default.
# Note that if the -p switch is used with gds2pov it will override the ProcessFile setting.
#
# The Font option allows the font to be used to be specified. The default is crystal.ttf (supplied with
# POV-Ray).
#
# Scale is used to scale the design. Scaling the design down can be useul for
# gdsoglviewer.

#
# Positions
# =========
#
# Position blocks are used for the camera and the lights. You can define the position of the item with one
# of the following keywords:
#
# Centre
# TopLeft
# TopRight
# BottomLeft
# BottomRight
#
# These are defined with respect to the way you view your layout. TopLeft is the top left of your layout as 
# you view it in your editor.
#
# The item will by default be placed at the height such that if it were the camera in the centre looking down 
# on the layout it would be able to see the entire layout.
#
# Note also that the Centre, TopLeft etc. positions will be added to the start of the POV file as comments to
# make hand modifying easier.
#
# You can also specify a modifier for each dimension in the position. The position will be multiplied by this 
# modifier. So, if you want something very close to the surface you could specify:
#
# ZMod: 0.1
#
# X and Y are the dimensions you use on the screen. Z goes into/out of your screen. Negative values are allowed!
#
# The default value is 1.0 for modifiers.
#
#
# Camera Position
# ===============
#
# Only one camera position is allowed!
# If none is specified, the camera will be placed in the Centre with all modifiers equal to 1.0.
#
# PositionStart
# Type: Camera
# Position: Centre
# XMod: 1.0
# YMod: 1.0
# ZMod: 1.0
# PositionEnd
#
#
# Look At Position
# ================
#
# This position defines where the camera will look. Only one Look At position is allowed!
# If none is specified, the camera will look at the Centre with the Z modifier equal to 0.0.
#
# PositionStart
# Type: LookAt
# Position: Centre
# XMod: 1.0
# YMod: 1.0
# ZMod: 0.0
# PositionEnd
#
#
# Light Positions
# ===============
#
# This type of position defines any additional lights. All lights are white. Any number of lights can be 
# specified, including none.
#
# PositionStart
# Type: Light
# Position: TopLeft
# XMod: 1.0
# YMod: 1.0
# ZMod: 1.0
# PositionEnd
